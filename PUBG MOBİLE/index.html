      <p>
        Pubg Mobile is a survival game. When you start the game, you jump from a
        plane and leave yourself to an area you want. Afterwards, wars begin
        with the collection of weapons and equipment. In these battles, you have
        to stay strong and struggle to survive in the game, while at the same
        time gaining power. The game can be challenging when you first start,
        because you have to fight with more than one person at the same time in
        your environment. It is possible to play with your friends in the game
        alone, as two people or as a team. While trying to survive in the group
        of 100 people jumping from the plane, you have to complete the progress
        you need.

        The Original Batle Royale, the First and the Best!
      </h1>

      <p>
        PUBG is a deathmatch game where nearly 100 players try to survive by
        killing each other on a large-scale map. Players can enter the game
        alone, in teams of 2 or 4, or alone against teams of 4. Players who
        choose to enter in groups alone are randomly matched as a team with
        different players. In all cases, players try to be the last player or
        team to win the game without dying. The team does not disband until all
        the players in the team die.When players land on the map, they have
        nothing to gain an edge over other players, except for their personal
        outfit choices, which have no effect on the game. Players search various
        buildings and areas to find various equipment such as helmets, armor,
        bags, weapons, bombs, vehicles. Equipment such as armor, helmet, bag has
        3 levels. At the same time, there are improvements for weapons such as
        scope (sight), extended shot magazine, various barrel tip improvements,
        silencer. Players are more likely to find better equipment and vehicles
        in certain areas of the map. As each player wants to find better quality
        equipment, they flock to these areas more and this makes these areas
        more dangerous. As the level increases, their capacity and quality also
        increase.

    <div class="map">
      <h1 class="map_era">ERANGEL</h1>
      <p>
        Erangel is the base map for the game. An 8x8 km map dotted with small outcroppings of buildings, the distance between major landmarks necessitates the use of vehicles to move between areas. As the game continues, the map area will be restricted to a smaller and smaller play area. A red circle will appear on the map from time to time, marking an area for offshore artillery to bombard. Erangel has varying weather, sometimes affecting visibility and requiring a change in tactics. <br>
        Cities and the local military base have plenty of decent loot, but you won't be the only one thinking the same thing. A mix of urban areas and wide open farmland create a wide variety of battles, ranging from intense close range firefights in streets and buildings, to long range sniping duels taking place across wheat fields.

      <h1 class="map_miramar">MIRAMAR</h1>

      <p>
        Miramar offers unique terrain and dense urban areas. With an island to
        the south east home to a prison and smaller villages, the entire area is
        cut off from the west and north-east by enormous canyons and mountains,
        with a looming metal wall to the north keeping outsiders out, and
        players in. Miramar will create a new Battle Royale experience where the
        old strategies from Erangel may no longer work and new tactics are
        required.

      <h1 class="map_viki">VIKENDI</h1>

      <p>
        The icy PUBG Vikendi map is one of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' most
        striking locales, with crisp white tundra as far as the eye can see.
        This map is one of the more diverse in terms of what you can actually
        find, with rocket launch pads, trains and more, but there's also a lot
        of little details that won't immediately by apparent to those players
        for whom this is all very fresh-fallen snow. It's also got plenty of
        elevation, but what really sets it apart is the addition of a tramline
        that runs through the map's center and around the outside, offering
        tactical options and considerations that you won't find in any of the
        game's other maps.

      <h1 class="map_viki">SANHOK</h1>

      <p>
        Sanhok is the first map that the art team of PUBG Corp visited a location specifically for world art development. By physically being in the jungles and mountains in a humid Asian country, it not only made them imagine what the new map will play like, but they felt the breeze, smelled the air and heard the sounds. All of these experiences are helping the team create a unique map experience.
<br>
        The map is inspired by a wide variety of islands in Thailand and the Philippines, the PUBG Art team; comprised of Technical Artists, Concept Artists and 3D Environment Artists, they took photos (Photogrammetry) to capture the island then transfer that to the game engine to design Sanhok
